# Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis

## Description
This project performs an exploratory analysis of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, focusing on total emissions, trends by industry and gas type, and country-level performance.

The objective is to provide insights into emission patterns, identify top emitters, and observe changes over time across sectors and gases.

The analysis is complemented by a dashboard created in Google Looker Studio.

---

## Key Questions Addressed
- What is the total emission per year?
- Which countries are the top emitters?
- How are emissions distributed by industry and gas type?
- How have emissions from specific industries changed over the years?
- How has the emission growth rate varied between years?
- What is the average emission per year?
- What are the maximum and minimum emission values per year?

---

## Data
- **Source:** Cleaned GHG Emissions dataset (processed using SQL queries).
- **Contents:** Yearly GHG emission data by country, industry sector, and gas type.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL (Data cleaning and aggregation)
- Python (optional for extended analysis)
- Google Looker Studio (for dashboard creation)

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Performed in SQL.
   - Normalized data structures for easier analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Computed total emissions per year.
   - Identified top emitting countries.
   - Analyzed emissions by industry sectors and gas types.
   - Evaluated year-over-year growth in specific sectors.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Developed an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio.
   - Graphs include time series, bar charts by country, industry breakdowns, and emission trends.
